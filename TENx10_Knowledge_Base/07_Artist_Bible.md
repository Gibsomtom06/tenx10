# SECTION 3: UNIFIED 6-AGENT SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

## System Overview
The unified system merges the DSR Centralized Portal and the Artist Bible Platform into one operating system. It operates on four layers:

| Layer | What It Is | Rule |
|:------|:-----------|:-----|
| Project Knowledge | Persistent background context — always loaded | If the agent needs it in every conversation, it lives here |
| MCP Connection | Live data from external tools and APIs | If data changes in real time and lives outside the system, connect via MCP |
| Skill | Reusable repeatable process — loaded only when relevant | If you repeat the same detailed process, make it a Skill |
| Subagent | Specialist agent with isolated context and one domain | If a task has its own domain, tools, and reports to the orchestrator |

## Unified Agent Map

| Agent | Domain | Key Skills |
|:------|:-------|:-----------|
| Agent 1: A&R | Music submission intake, scoring (Quality 40%/Reach 30%/Fit 30%), partner vote queue, user profile assignment | ar_scoring.py, Score A&R Submission, Assign User Profile Type |
| Agent 2: Bookings | Show offer intake, routing, negotiation, confirmation, contracts, financials, advance tracking, folder creation, promoter/venue grading | show_onboarding.py, show_commission.py, show_grading.py, show_status.py, show_competition.py |
| Agent 3: Tour Marketing | Campaign execution (4-phase system), ad operations, budget allocation, geo-targeting, CPT tracking, Smart Audience ads, DSP-aware targeting | show_budget.py, show_ad_copy.py, show_geo.py, show_cpt.py, meta-ads-analyzer skill |
| Agent 4: Creative & Content | Asset management, flyer generation (using tour support grid), social content calendars, release marketing calendars | show_content.py, show_support.py |
| Agent 5: Marketing & Promo | Promo team management, points/leaderboard, UGC verification, DSP growth automation | promo_points.py |
| Agent 6: Tech | API health, database integrity, voting logic enforcement (2/3 hard constraint), user records, audit logging, MCP monitoring | dsr_orchestrator.py |

## Workflow Pipeline
```
DEAL CONFIRMED → Agent 2 (Bookings/Onboarding) → Agent 2 (Financials/Docs) → Agent 4 (Creative) → Agent 3 (Tour Marketing) + Agent 4 (Social Content)
```

## Approval Chain
1. Thomas Nalian — Single point of approval for ALL show offers
2. Leigh Bray (DirtySnatcha) — Must sign off on all confirmed shows
3. Label Partners (x3) — 2/3 majority vote for A&R decisions

Nothing is confirmed without both Thomas and Leigh signing off. No A&R submission is approved without 2/3 partner vote.

---

# SECTION 4: LABEL OPERATIONS

## A&R Gate
- 2/3 majority vote from three label partners required to approve any submission or contract
- Voting window: 72 hours from dossier push. No 2/3 decision → auto-escalate to Tie/Stalled queue

## A&R Scoring Formula
```
Composite = (Quality × 0.40) + (Reach × 0.30) + (Fit × 0.30)
```
Each dimension scored 1-10. Composite determines queue priority.

### Quality (1-10)
- 8-10: Release-ready mixdown, original sound design, professional mastering, Shazam recognition or editorial playlist placement
- 5-7: Solid production, minor mixdown issues, some playlist traction
- 3-4: Decent ideas but significant production gaps
- 1-2: Unfinished, poor mixdown, derivative

### Reach (1-10)
- 8-10: 50K+ monthly listeners, 10K+ social following, positive Google Trends
- 5-7: 10K-50K monthly listeners, 2K-10K social
- 3-4: 1K-10K monthly listeners, under 2K social
- 1-2: Under 1K monthly listeners

### Fit (1-10)
- 8-10: Core bass/electronic genre, aesthetic aligns with DSR brand, clear growth trajectory
- 5-7: Adjacent genre with crossover potential
- 3-4: Genre stretch, limited brand alignment
- 1-2: Wrong genre entirely

## Acceptance Path
Approved submissions trigger automated contract generation + Project Room unlock (WAVs, stems, marketing plans).

## Rejection Path
Rejected submissions receive thank-you email with the "opinions are like assholes" disclaimer. User stays in portal to track future submissions.

## Waitlist Logic
Singles may be signed but held for Compilation Queue to fill release schedule gaps.

## Release Path
Artist progresses: Single → EP → LP. Tracked from demo to Takeover eligibility.

# SECTION 9: SUPPORT ARTIST SYSTEM

## Approved Support Artists (2026 Tour)

### Primary Supports
- **WHOiSEE** (NC) — Tier 1 (heaviest draw)
- **Dark Matter** (Chicago/Knoxville) — Tier 1
- **Mport** (high-demand mid-tier) — Tier 1
- **Kotrax** (Denver — Frontier flight pass) — Tier 2 (flexible, affordable)
- **HVRCRFT** (Las Vegas/San Francisco) — Tier 2
- **Ozztin** (Denver) — Tier 2

### Canada-Only
- **Zurglin** — Only if Canada routing activated
- **Walter Wilde** — Only if Canada routing activated (visas pending)

## Assignment Logic Rules
1. Proximity First — choose supports closest to market
2. Genre Alignment — all must be riddim/dubstep/heavy bass
3. Radius Clauses — check per artist (e.g., WHOiSEE excluded from Minneapolis)
4. Tour Momentum — riskier markets get heavier supports
5. Weekend Priority — strongest supports (WHOiSEE, Dark Matter) on weekends
6. Weekday Priority — flexible supports (Kotrax, HVRCRFT, Ozztin) on weekdays
7. Promoter Pays Everything — support costs NEVER reduce headline fee

## Expected Support Costs (Promoter Budgeting)
- Local supports: $200-$500
- Regional supports: $300-$700
- Major supports (Mport/WHOiSEE/Dark Matter): $700-$1,200
- Travel: promoter decides

# SECTION 12: DSP ALGORITHMIC INTELLIGENCE

## Core Grading System

### Track Quality Score (ISRC Level)
- **30-Second Rule:** High skip rate before 30 seconds = permanently shadow-demoted
- **Bucket Logic:** All streams/saves/shares for an ISRC go into one data bucket. Changing ISRC resets to 0.
- **Threshold:** ISRC needs ~30+ out of 100 on Spotify to trigger algorithmic takeovers (Discover Weekly, Release Radar)

### Artist Quality Score (Profile Level)
- **Active Search Weight:** #1 driver. Manual "dirtysnatcha" searches = "Destination Artist" status
- **Inherited Authority:** High Artist Score gives new ISRCs algorithmic multiplier (test groups of 1,000+ instead of 100)
- **Consistency Decay:** No new ISRC every 6-8 weeks = Artist Quality Score decays

## DSP-Specific Intelligence

### Spotify
- Track Quality: Popularity Index (0-100). Save-to-Stream Ratio target: >10%
- Hack: Radio Priming — run conversion ads focused on "Saves" to hit 10% threshold
- Tools: S4A Editorial Pitching (14+ days early), Discovery Mode, Marquee & Showcase, Canvas & Clips

### Apple Music
- Track Quality: Library Add Velocity (LAV)
- Hack: Shazam Spiking — geo-target social ads to one mid-sized city for regional "Trending" alert
- Tools: AM4A Pitching (favors high-res imagery + synced lyrics), Artist Messages (voice notes)

### YouTube
- Track Quality: Watch-History Affinity
- Hack: Shorts Pivot — link ISRC to YouTube Shorts. High "Audio Re-use" = massive Track Quality vote
- Tools: OAC Unification, Community Posts

### Pandora
- Track Quality: Thumbs Up/Down Ratio (extremely ruthless)
- Hack: Featured Tracks — force-feed one ISRC for up to 8 weeks
- Tools: Pandora AMP, Artist Audio Messages (AAM)

### Amazon Music
- Track Quality: Voice Request Index (Alexa requests)
- Hack: Natural Language Optimization — ensure lyrics in metadata for Alexa conversational search
- Tools: Voice Intro Pitching, Spotlight

### SoundCloud
- Track Quality: Engagement-to-Play Ratio (comments, likes, reposts)
- Hack: 100-Listener Test — AI forces track to 100 people, their reaction dictates viral cap
- Tools: Next Pro Pitching → "Daily Drops" feed

### TikTok
- Track Quality: Sound Re-use & Completion Rate (rewatches = 5x more than Like)
- Hack: Search-First SEO — title with high-volume keywords (e.g., "heavy bass drop 2026")
- Tools: TikTok Artist Hub, Commercial Music Library (CML)

## Supply Chain & Waterfalling
- **ISRC (The DNA):** Unique to audio. NEVER change it.
- **UPC (The Vessel):** Unique to product. ALWAYS change for new bundle.
- **Waterfall Execution:** When moving Single to EP, put exact same ISRC inside new UPC. Album debuts with accumulated Track Quality Score.
- **Multi-Distributor 48-Hour Rule:** Upload to new distro with identical metadata. Wait for Spotify to link. Only then takedown old distro.

## 3-Pillar Rights Safety Net
1. **Performance Rights (BMI/ASCAP/SOCAN):** Composition protection. Generates ISWC.
2. **Reproduction Rights (CMRRA/The MLC):** Mechanical protection. Bridges ISRC to ISWC.
3. **Neighboring Rights (SoundExchange):** Sound recording protection. Verifies ISRC is "Broadcast Ready."

## Cover/Flip Protocol
- Locate original ISWC
- Secure Mechanical License (via HFA/Songfile)
- Link new ISRC to original ISWC in VMG portal

  - Stream Growth: Drive Smart Audience from social to streaming services (on release day and after, most effective when primed by Fan Engagement)
- Smart Audience targeting is based on streaming behavior, not social behavior — more precise than standard Meta targeting
